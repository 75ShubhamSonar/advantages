            <li> Vermicompost has higher values of nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus. These three elements are super important for the growth of plants. Adding vermicompost organic fertilizer in the soil is one of the best ways to ensure that your plants are getting enough nutrients.</li> 
            <li>Vermicompost, also known as earthworm castings, is rich in nutrients that benefit plants: <br>
 
                Nitrogen: 1.2–2.5% <br>
                 
                Phosphorus: 0.9–1.7% <br>
                 
                Potassium: 1.5–2.5% 
                 
                Organic carbon: 9.8–13.4% </li>
             <li>Secondary and micronutrients: Sulfur, calcium, magnesium, boron, zinc, copper, iron, manganese, molybdenum, chlorine, and nickel </li>   
             <li>Coelomic fluid: Promotes plant growth </li>
             <li>Vermicompost also contains beneficial soil microbes and plant growth hormones and enzymes. It helps plants grow, improves the quality and shelf life of produce, and protects plants from pests and diseases. 
                Vermicompost's worm mucus helps prevent nutrients from washing away when it rains, and it holds moisture better than plain soil.</li>

        <li>Chemical fertilizers are majorly responsible for polluting the soil. It happens because they get leached out pretty easily whereas vermicompost does not get leach out.</li></p>
        <li>Poor soil conditions are frequently blamed for poor plant health. Consequently, it's crucial to create a healthy atmosphere for plants to grow. There are numerous strategies to enhance soil quality, crop output, and financial results, whether you are a gardener or someone who grows vegetables or fruits at home</li>
        <li>Chemical fertilizer is a soil amendment that contains a wide range of nutrients, including nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium, which are crucial for plant growth. However, utilizing chemicals has a number of drawbacks, including negative impacts on the environment, human health, and soil.</li>
        <li>Why are compost better then chemical fertilizers?
            To improve the fertility of the soil, compost is a mixture of various organic materials, which breaks down into simple organic and inorganic molecules.
            The process of composting is the breakdown of a mixture of organic waste, such as leftover food, fruit and vegetable scraps, garden waste, livestock manure, etc. in a pit or bin. Microorganisms interact with the organic materials, breaking it down and converting it into a natural fertilizer. The decomposed organic waste, also referred to as "black gold," is subsequently employed to improve crop output and soil health.

       <li> Due to the fact that vermicompost is organic, neither does it harm human health nor pollute the soil or water. Additionally, it doesn’t leave a lasting impression. Some chemical fertilizers, such as urea, leave behind an acidic residue that reduces soil production.</li></p>

       <li>The advantages of vermicomposting are that it is a nutrient-rich organic fertilizer that helps promote plant growth. Every household produces nearly tons of waste every year, and it contributes in the soil pollution. The organic waste collected from the kitchen can be turned into something nutritious for the plants – vermicompost. </li>
       <li>One of the most effective natural processes for creating great garden compost from organic waste is vermicomposting, also referred to as worm composting. Additionally, it is easy to deploy and scalable. Consequently, it is a worthwhile endeavor regardless of the size of your garden. The methods through which worms, bacteria, and fungi decompose organic waste are mimicked in vermicomposting. Even though it uses the same methods, it is far faster.</li>

<summary><h4>4. Contains Growth Hormones </h4></summary>

    <p class="solid font"><ul>
       <li> One of the advantages of vermicomposting is that it helps imprtoving growth rate of plants. The fertilizer is rich in enzymes, vitamins, and other vital nutrients such as Gibberellin and Auxin.</li> </p>
       <li>This study focuses on the effect of the epigeic earthworm Eudrilus eugeniae (with and without addition) to transform solid state fermented (SSF) and submerged (SmF) state fermented TFL mixed with cow dung and leaf litter into value added products in compost and vermicompost bioreactors respectively. </li>
       <li>The significant role of microbes was identified during compost and vermicompost process. In addition, three important phytohormones (Indole 3-acetic acid, Gibberellic acid, Kinetin) were also detected in the compost and vermicompost products.</li>
       <li>The results revealed that the maximum amount of plant hormones were available in the vermicompost products which may be due to the joint action of earthworm and microorganisms. The overall results confirmed that the vermicomposting process produced a greater value added product.</li>

<summary><h4>5.Ensure Zero Waste </h4></summary>

    <p class="solid font"><ul>
        <li>As mentioned earlier, advantages of vermicomposting includes usage of wastage from the kitchen. A large chunk of household waste can be turned into a nutrients rich fertilizer without much hassle.</li></p>
        <li>The various earthworm species such as red worms, tiger worms, and red wigglers are responsible for consuming organic waste such as flower waste, agricultural waste, animal waste, sewage sludge, etc. During the vermicomposting process, the digestive process of the earthworm is used as vermicompost.</li>
        <li>Under favorable temperature < 28°C, moisture content (60–80%) and suitable aerobic condition the earthworms ingest organic waste such as vegetable waste, flower waste, kitchen waste or industrial sludge and excrete a humus-like substance. </li>
        <li>The earthworm has two profits in which one is the conversion of organic or industrial sludges into vermicompost, and other is control of pollution of solid waste which arises from the faster-increasing rate of population, urbanization, intensive agriculture, and industrialization. The benefit of vermicomposting is that it can be done into the house-hold or community or city scale food waste or organic waste.</li>
